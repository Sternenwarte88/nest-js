## Introduction - the project's aim

---

I settled this backend solution up for security reasons. Showing how I secure my Database and sensitiv informations in the frontend is not th ebest possible solution.

In the past, it startet to learning Node.js/Express.js. Today I learned Nest.js and it was so amazing, that I decide to write my backend solution again, but this time on Nest.js.

## Technologies

---

- Typescript 4.1.5
- TS-Node 9.1.1
- ESlint 7.20.0
- Prettier 2.2.1
- EJS (for landing Page)

## Launch

---

I pepared a .env file. Simple fill out all empty variables. This will configure this server.

Get this files on your server or local and run `yarn add` or `npm install`. This will install all dependencies, wich are important.
After that, just `yarn start` or `npm start` and this will bring up this server.
